# Coursera Python 
# An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)
#

My solution to the mini projects used in IIPP course on Coursera platform.

The code in github should be used in interactive Python web IDE accessible at:
http://www.codeskulptor.org/

You can just copy/paste the full raw code on the left windows of CodeSkulptor and then hit the "run" icon.

More informations are available in the course sillabus available at:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1
and
https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2

Disclaimer: As per the Coursera code conduct policies you're not allowed to use my solutions for your assignments.
However you're more than welcome to check my code to find suggestion or inspiration for your study.
