# An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)

Part 1 - Assignment source code

My solutions to the assignments used in IIPP course on Coursera platform (http://www.coursera.com)

I took this course few months ago, I found it to be really exciting and useful to learn Python in a fun and interactive way. Since the course is free, I really reccomend it to anybody.

The code in github can be used in interactive Python web IDE accessible at:
http://www.codeskulptor.org/
You can just copy/paste the full raw code on the left windows of CodeSkulptor and then hit the "run" icon.

Some code is directly compatible with Python 2.7, some other no (because it uses proprietary GUI libraries from Coursera that works only in CodeSkulptor)

More information is available in the course sillabus at:

and \n

Disclaimer: As per the Coursera code conduct policies you're not allowed to use my solutions for your assignments.
If you're found copying you'll be excluded from the course.
However you're more than welcome to check my code for hints or ideas to reach your own solution to the proposed assignments.
